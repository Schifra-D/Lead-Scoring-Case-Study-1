Logistic Regression - Classification Model analysis done by Schifra Daruwalla and Arun Karra
## Problem Statement
#### Company X Education is an online education plateform which specialises in selling online courses to industry professionals. The company has its course on various various websites and search engines. People who fill up details related to them (such as name, phone number, email address etc) or are referred by other clients are considered as leads (potential clients). X Education receives plenty of leads, however the leads being converted into clients is extremely low. In a 100 leads per day, only 30 of them are converted to clients.  
## Business Objectives
#### The Three Business Objectives in this Case Study are: 

*    To help X Education select the most potential leads, i.e ‘Hot Leads’ which are likely to be converted into clients.
*    To build a model in such a way that each lead is assigned a lead score where the higher lead score signals higher chances of conversion an lower lead score            signals lower chances of conversions.
*    The target lead conversion rate should be around 80%.
